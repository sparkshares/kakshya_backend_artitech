• Process control
 ◦ end, abort

 ◦ set process, file, or device attributes
• Communications
 ◦ create, delete communication connection
 ◦ send, receive messages
 ◦ transfer status information
 ◦ attach or detach remote devicesSystem Programs
• System programs provide a convenient environment for program 
development and execution. • Access to a shared resource allows:
 – Computation speed -up
 – Increased data availability
 – Enhanced reliability
Command -Interpreter System
• Many commands are given to the operating system by control
statements which deal with:
 – process creation and management
 – I/O handling
 – secondary -storage management
 – main -memory management
 – file-system access
 – protection
 – networkingOperating  System  Services
• Program  execution  – system  capability  to load a program  into memory  
and to run it. The can be divided into:
 – File manipulation
 – Status information
 – File modification
 – Programming language support
 – Program loading and execution
 – Communications
 – Application programs
• Most users’ view of the operation system is defined by system programs, 
not the actual system calls.System Structure – Simple Approach
• MS -DOS – written to provide the most functionality in the least space
 – not divided into modules
 – Although MS -DOS has some structure, its interfaces and levels of   
   functionality are not well separated. • The operating system is responsible for the following activities in
connection with disk management:
 – Free space management
 – Storage allocation
 – Disk scheduling
I/O System Management
• The I/O system consists of:
 – A buffer -caching system
 – A general device -driver interface
 – Drivers for specific hardware devicesFile Management
• A file is a collection of related information defined by its creator. The can be divided into:
 – File manipulation
 – Status information
 – File modification
 – Programming language support
 – Program loading and execution
 – Communications
 – Application programs
• Most users’ view of the operation system is defined by system programs, 
not the actual system calls.System Programs
• System programs provide a convenient environment for program 
development and execution. To summarize it in a 
nutshell, the operating system provides a variety of services that 
programs can obtain using special instructions called system calls.Operating -System Structures
System Components: Common System Components are
• Process Management
• Main Memory Management
• Secondary -Storage Management
• I/O System Management
• File Management
• Protection System
• Networking
• Command -Interpreter System
Process Management
• A process is a program in execution. The advantages  of distributed  systems  are- With 
resource  sharing  facility  user at one site may be able to use the 
resources  available  at another,  Speedup  the exchange  of data with one 
another  via electronic  mail,  If one site fails in a distributed  system,  the 
remaining  sites can potentially  continue  operating,  Better  service  to the 
customers,  Reduction  of the load on the host computer .❖Operating System as Resource Manager:
• Operating system is collection of software which is close to hardware. • Protection  – ensuring  that all access  to system  resources  is controlled .System  Calls
• System  calls provide  the interface  between  a running  program  and the 
operating  system . The operating system 
keeps in trace that who is using which resource to grant resource required 
amount for usage and to mediate conflicting required different programs 
and users.❖Operating System as Extended Machine:
• The program that hides the truth about the hardware from the 
programmer and presents a nice, simple view of named files that can be 
read and written is, of course, the operating system. – Allocate and deallocate memory space as needed.Secondary -Storage Management
• Since main memory ( primary storage) is volatile and too small to
accommodate all data and programs permanently, the computer
system must provide secondary storage to back up main
memory.
